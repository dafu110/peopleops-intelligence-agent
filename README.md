# PeopleOps Intelligence Agent

PeopleOps Intelligence Agent is an AI-native HRBP workbench for policy Q&A, resume/JD matching, candidate follow-up actions, approvals, audit evidence, and local ATS-style records. It is designed as a practical enterprise-console reference project rather than a single-purpose RAG demo.

## Reading Guide

Start here if you are reviewing the project for the first time:

1. **Product Snapshot**: what the app does and what the UI looks like.
2. **Quick Start**: how to run the professional web console and API locally.
3. **Closed-Loop Experience**: how the operator flow works end to end.
4. **Core Capabilities**: which agent, RAG, governance, and persistence pieces are included.
5. **Architecture, API, and Configuration**: implementation and deployment details.

## Product Snapshot

The primary product surface is now a Next.js web console backed by the FastAPI control plane. It uses a professional three-panel workbench: context intake on the left, a single Agent conversation workspace in the center, and evidence, approvals, runtime state, and audit signals on the right.

The screenshot below is a live run of the Next.js web console. The Streamlit workbench remains available only as an optional local demo/debug surface.

## Quick Start

Run the FastAPI backend:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Run the professional frontend in another terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

The Streamlit demo can still be started from the backend folder with:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

On Windows, if dependency installation fails while unpacking `torch` because the repository path is too deep, use the short-path setup in [`docs/clean-install-and-test.md`](docs/clean-install-and-test.md).

## Closed-Loop Experience

The app is organized around the daily flow of an HR operator.

- **Assemble context**: upload candidate resumes, paste the JD, preview extracted resume text, and check runtime readiness.
- **Agent judgment**: route questions to policy RAG, resume/JD matching, or action tools through the LangGraph workflow from one primary input.
- **Execute action**: create local candidate follow-up actions, email drafts, calendar artifacts, approval requests, and ATS sync payloads.
- **Governance evidence**: review recent actions, pending approvals, audit events, connector readiness, and audit-chain integrity.

The product UI intentionally avoids duplicate search boxes: evidence retrieval is shown as part of the Agent workflow rather than exposed as a second manual query path.

## Core Capabilities

- AI agent workflow in `backend/core/workflow.py` with intent routing for RAG, resume analysis, and tool execution.
- Enterprise policy retrieval in `backend/core/rag_engine.py` with persistent Chroma indexing and page-aware citations.
- Resume/JD matching in `backend/core/matcher.py` with structured fit analysis output.
- Local tool execution in `backend/core/tools.py` for candidate follow-up scheduling, email drafts, calendar `.ics` files, ATS exports, and approval gates.
- SQLite persistence in `backend/core/database.py` for users, action records, approval requests, tenant scope, and RAG eval metrics.
- Security and governance foundations: access password support, roles, tenant headers, PII redaction, hash-chained audit logs, and audit integrity checks.
- FastAPI control plane in `backend/api.py` for health, readiness, identity, chat, action records, approvals, connectors, and audit endpoints.
- Deployment assets: `infra/Dockerfile`, `infra/docker-compose.yml`, `.devcontainer`, and deployment notes under `docs/`.

## Architecture

```text

        |
LangGraph workflow
  |-- intent router
  |-- policy RAG node
  |-- resume matcher node
  `-- tool execution node
        |
Engineering services
  |-- SQLite app database
  |-- persistent Chroma index + manifest invalidation
  |-- hash-chained audit JSONL
  |-- PII redaction
  |-- local ATS records
  |-- email draft artifacts
  `-- calendar ICS artifacts
```

## API Backend

```powershell
cd backend
python -m uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /readiness`
- `GET /me`
- `POST /chat`
- `GET /interviews`
- `GET /approvals`
- `GET /connectors`
- `GET /audit/events`
- `GET /audit/integrity`

When `ACCESS_PASSWORD` is configured, pass `X-Access-Password`.
For multi-tenant API calls, pass `X-Tenant-ID`, `X-Org-ID`, and `X-Department-ID`; local defaults are used when these headers are absent.
When `REQUIRE_ACCESS_PASSWORD=true`, the API refuses authenticated operations until `ACCESS_PASSWORD` is configured.

## Enterprise Controls

- Set `ENTERPRISE_MODE=true` and `REQUIRE_ACCESS_PASSWORD=true` before exposing the API beyond a local demo.
- Store `ACCESS_PASSWORD` as `pbkdf2_sha256$...`; plain text and legacy `sha256:` values are accepted for compatibility but reported in readiness warnings.
- Generate a password hash with `python backend/scripts/hash_password.py`, then paste the output into `.env` as `ACCESS_PASSWORD`.
- Use `TOOL_EXECUTION_MODE=approval` when candidate follow-up actions should create an auditable pending action instead of immediately generating email, calendar, or ATS artifacts.
- Use `X-Tenant-ID`, `X-Org-ID`, and `X-Department-ID` on API calls to isolate action records, approvals, audit context, and downstream ATS payloads.
- Review `/approvals` before executing follow-up messages, rejection drafts, offer drafts, calendar invites, or ATS stage changes.
- Review `/connectors` to see which enterprise HRIS, ATS, collaboration, mail, and calendar integrations are configured or still planned.
- Use `/audit/events` for recent audit inspection; each record includes a request ID and a hash-chain pointer to make accidental tampering visible.
- Use `/audit/integrity` to verify the audit hash chain before exporting evidence or closing an incident review.
- Treat SQLite, local files, and local Chroma as a reference implementation. For production, move state to PostgreSQL, object storage, and a managed vector/search service with tenant isolation.

## Docker
